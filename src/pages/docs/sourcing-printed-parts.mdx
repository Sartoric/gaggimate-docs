GaggiMate requires a handful of printed parts to function. You will need to either print these yourself or buy them in the shop. You will probably also be able to find a place locally to make these for you.

It is recommended not to use PLA for these as it has a low melting point and might easily break when printing flexible tabs. You can use materials like PETG, ABS, ASA.

## All routes - Display housing

### BOM
* <span class="font-mono bg-slate-100 p-1 text-sm">stls/display/case_front.stl</span> [(Github)](https://github.com/jniebuhr/gaggimate/blob/master/stls/display/case_front.stl) (Print 2 if unsure about sturdyness of the print)
* <span class="font-mono bg-slate-100 p-1 text-sm">stls/display/case_back.stl</span> [(Github)](https://github.com/jniebuhr/gaggimate/blob/master/stls/display/case_back.stl)
* 4 pcs 6x3mm Neodymium Magnet N52  [(AliExpress)](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_EjwXuaU) (Ignore this if you want to screw down the display)
* LilyGo T-RGB (See other sourcing pages)

### Assembly

Push the magnets into the 4 holes if you're going for a magnetic install, otherwise drill holes into your machine and screw it down with the provided screw holes.
The magnets should hold by themselves, if they're a bit loose you can use a dab of superglue.

Sit the screen inside of the case back and align the connectors correctly. Now carefully push the case front down onto the screen until it clicks into place.
This will bend the tabs outside along the layerlines so be careful not to break them.

### Variant: Angled display housing

<Image src={imgScreenAngledExploded} width={800} alt="Exploded View" />

#### BOM

* <span class="font-mono bg-slate-100 p-1 text-sm">stls/display/case_front.stl</span> [(Github)](https://github.com/jniebuhr/gaggimate/blob/master/stls/display/case_front.stl) (Print 2 if unsure about sturdyness of the print)
* <span class="font-mono bg-slate-100 p-1 text-sm">stls/display/angled</span> [(Github)](https://github.com/jniebuhr/gaggimate/blob/master/stls/display/angled) (Choose the correct back part for your machine)
* LilyGo T-RGB (See other sourcing pages)

#### Assembly

Sit the screen inside of the case back and align the connectors correctly. Now carefully push the case front down onto the screen until it clicks into place.
This will bend the tabs outside along the layerlines so be careful not to break them.

## PCB Route - PCB Casing
<Image src={imgPcbExploded} width={800} alt="Exploded View" />

### BOM
* <span class="font-mono bg-slate-100 p-1 text-sm">stls/pcb/pcb_clipped_base.stl</span> [(Github)](https://github.com/jniebuhr/gaggimate/blob/master/stls/pcb/pcb_clipped_base.stl)
* <span class="font-mono bg-slate-100 p-1 text-sm">stls/pcb/pcb_clipped_cover.stl</span> [(Github)](https://github.com/jniebuhr/gaggimate/blob/master/stls/pcb/pcb_clipped_cover.stl) (Print 2 if unsure about sturdyness of the print)
* GaggiMate Controller PCB (See other sourcing pages)
* Double sided tape (VHB or similar)

### Assembly

Sit the PCB on top of the case bottom and align the mounting holes correctly. Now carefully push the cover down onto the base until it clicks into place.
This will bend the tabs outside along the layerlines so be careful not to break them.

## Lego Route - Lego Casing

This is currently work in progress.
