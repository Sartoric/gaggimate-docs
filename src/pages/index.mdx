This project upgrades a Gaggia espresso machine with smart controls to improve your coffee-making experience. By adding a display and custom electronics, you can monitor and control the machine more easily.

## Features

- **Temperature Control**: Monitor the boiler temperature to ensure optimal brewing conditions.
- **Brew timer**: Set a target duration and run the brewing for the specific time.
- **Steam and Hot Water mode**: Control the pump and valve to run the respective task.
- **Safety Features**: Automatic shutoff if the system becomes unresponsive or overheats.
- **User Interface**: Simple, intuitive display to control and monitor the machine.

## How to buy

The shop is now open for preorders and you can buy your kit on [https://shop.gaggimate.eu/](https://shop.gaggimate.eu/).

## Installation

The installation process of this mod consists of purely electrical changes. You will have to wire up the 3-Way valve and pump to the relays provided on the board. The existing thermostats of your machine have to be removed and bridged while connecting the heater to the SSR instead. The M4 thermistor goes into the screw hole where the brew thermostat would usually sit.

I will soon update this with detailed instructions.
