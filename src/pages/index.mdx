This project upgrades a Gaggia espresso machine with smart controls to improve your coffee-making experience. By adding a display and custom electronics, you can monitor and control the machine more easily.

## Features

- **PID Boiler Control**: Monitor and control the boiler temperature to ensure the optimal temperature for your coffee.
- **Brew by time / Brew by weight**: Set a target duration or weight and stop automatically at your target.
- **Hot Water mode**: Set a separate temperature to pull hot water from your machine
- **Pro Steam**: We enhance the steam from a Gaggia by raising the temperature and running the pump at a low rate to keep water in the boiler.
- **Safety Features**: Automatic shutoff if the system becomes unresponsive or overheats.
- **Minimalistic Touch UI**: Simple, intuitive display to control and monitor the machine.
