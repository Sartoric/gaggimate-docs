Going the PCB route is the recommended way to install GaggiMate. The store is now open at [https://shop.gaggimate.eu/](https://shop.gaggimate.eu/) and you can source it either as part of a kit that comes with pre-crimped wires included or on its own. If you buy the kit you won't need any of the components below.
