Now everything is setup, and ready to go. But what does all these shiny new things on my display really mean? Let me walk you through them.

### GaggiMate Starting...

![Screen has 2 text lines, first showing the GaggiMate logo. Second saying "Starting..."](../../assets/images/ScreenUiDescriptions/0-Starting.png)

<p>This will be the very first screen you ever see with your GaggiMate screen.<br>
It is shown when the screen starts up, and will stay this way until a bluetooth connection with the controller PCB has been made.</p>

### Standby Screen

![Standby screen, showing 3 logos explained below, a clock, the GaggiMate logo and a touch symbol.](../../assets/images/ScreenUiDescriptions/1-Standby-screen.png)

<p>This screen is the standby screen, this will be shown when there is a connection to the controller PCB, and the GaggiMate system is in standby mode, meaning that the heater and pump is turned off.</p>
<p>This screen has 3 possible logos in the top section. I'll explain each, going from left to right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wifi symbol. If present, the GaggiMate is connected to a wifi connection, hopefully yours?!</li>
<li>Bluetooth icon. This icon is shown when the screen has a bluetooth connection to the Controller PCB.</li>
<li>Update icon. This signifies that there is an update available to either the screen, the controller PCB or both. It will only appear if the screen is connected to the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The clock will be set automaticlly, but you might have to visit the settings page to set the right timezone for you, unless you prefer Italian Espresso Time to be your timezone.
<br>When you touch the screen in this mode, it will switch to brew mode.</p>

### Main Menu

![Standby screen, showing 3 logos explained below, a clock, the GaggiMate logo and a touch symbol.](../../assets/images/ScreenUiDescriptions/2-Main-menu.png)

<p>The main menu is used to navigate the different modes that GaggiMate offers.</p>
<p>This screen has one or two gauges around the menu menus. On the Standart version of the GaggiMate system, you will have 1 gauge showing temperature. On the Pro verison you will have 2, the left one being temperature, and the right one being pressue. In both cases you will have a nummeric value of the gauge/gauges current reading.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the screen you will have a power-botton symbol, if you press this, your GaggiMate system will enter Standby mode.</p>
</p>In the middle of the screen you will have 4 symbols in 2 rows.
<ul>
<li><b>Top row</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Brew mode, on the left.</li>
    <li>Steam mode, on the right.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Bottom row</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Water mode, on the left.</li>
    <li>Grinder mode, on the right.</li>
    </ul>
