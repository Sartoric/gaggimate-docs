Going the PCB route is the more integrated and clean solution and is recommended but it will require you to either buy the PCB as part of the kit or order it from a source like JLCPCB or PCBWay. It is reasonsably easy to solder yourself if you have some soldering experience and a hotplate. Make sure to order a stencil along the PCB.
