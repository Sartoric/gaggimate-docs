So you flashed and installed your GaggiMate kit. Here's what to do next!

### WiFi Setup

When you first boot your GaggiMate setup it will start up and show only a Bluetooth icon on the standby screen.
This indicates you either haven't configured any WiFi credentials yet (since it's the first boot) or that the WiFi connection failed.
It will launch a WiFi AP in that case so you can change configuration. Scan the QR Code below to connect or simply connect to GaggiMate.

</div>

You can then visit the configuration page of GaggiMate. Since mDNS doesn't work in AP mode you have to visit [http://192.168.4.1/](http://192.168.4.1/).
Click on Settings, configure your WiFi and you're ready to go. Once it rebooted and connected to your own WiFi you can always access the settings on [http://gaggimate.local](http://gaggimate.local).
